# Nextion development

Haven't found an easy way to import export screens between different sizes, you can use the export function in NExtion that creates a .page file that can be imported into another project.

However if you try to go from larger to smaller all sorts of errors with wrong dimensions.

These page files are just text extracts of the most important logic fields, that I try to keep consistent between models.
